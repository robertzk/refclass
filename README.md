R Reference Classes [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robertzk/refclass.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robertzk/refclass)
===================

A re-factoring of R's built-in reference classes to make the code understandable.

**Note**. This project is deprecated in light of [R6](https://github.com/wch/R6),
which offers much more elegant and lightweight mutable OOP support to R. There is
no point in continuing with reference classes.
