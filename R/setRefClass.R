#' Create a new reference class.

#' Reference class objects are the closest approximation of the concepts of
#' object-oriented programming available in R. While S3 and S4 classes serve
#' the useful purpose of providing dispatching mechanisms on generic functions,
#' reference classes allow for mutability of data on the underlying object
#' regardless of calling convention (or nasty syntax like replace methods).
